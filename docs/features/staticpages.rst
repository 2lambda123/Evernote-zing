Static Pages
============

Pootle makes it easy to setup additional custom content without too much
effort.

There are three types of static pages:

#. Regular -- these work like normal web pages and are able to present
   additional content such as a "Getting Started" page.  You will want to add
   these into other :doc:`UI customisation </developers/customization>`.
#. Legal -- in addition to presenting content like a Regular page, Legal pages
   require that users agree to the content otherwise they are logged off the
   system.  Use these pages for presenting terms of service or changes in
   licensing terms that user must accept before they can use or continue to use
   Pootle.


Use **Admin -- Static Pages** to create and manage static pages.
