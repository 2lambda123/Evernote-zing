Zing Documentation
==================

Zing is an online tool that makes the process of translating so much simpler.
It allows crowd-sourced translations, easy volunteer contribution and gives
statistics about the ongoing work.

Zing is built using the powerful API of the `Translate Toolkit
<http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/translate-toolkit/en/latest/>`_ and the
:ref:`Django framework <django:index-first-steps>`.
